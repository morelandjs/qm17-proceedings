% This file contains modifications for Nuclear Physics B Proceedings Supplement

% Changes since version 1.1
% - added "procedia" option compliant with ecrc.sty version 1.2a
%   (makes the layout approximately the same as the Word CRC template)
% - added example for generating copyright line in abstract

%% The ecrc package defines commands needed for running heads and logos.
%% For running heads, you can set the journal name, the volume, the starting page and the authors

%% set the volume if you know. Otherwise `00'
\volume{00}

%% set the starting page if not 1
\firstpage{1}

%% Give the name of the journal
\journalname{Nuclear Physics A}

%% Give the author list to appear in the running head
%% Example \runauth{C.V. Radhakrishnan et al.}
\runauth{J.S.\ Moreland, J.E.\ Bernhard, W.\ Ke, S.A.\ Bass}

%% The choice of journal logo is determined by the \jid and \jnltitlelogo commands.
%% A user-supplied logo with the name <\jid>logo.pdf will be inserted if present.
%% e.g. if \jid{yspmi} the system will look for a file yspmilogo.pdf
%% Otherwise the content of \jnltitlelogo will be set between horizontal lines as a default logo

%% Give the abbreviation of the Journal.
\jid{nupha}

%% Give a short journal name for the dummy logo (if needed)
\jnltitlelogo{Nuclear Physics A}

%% Hereafter the template follows `elsarticle'.

\begin{abstract}
We study the effects of nucleon substructure on bulk observables in proton-lead collisions at the LHC using systematic Bayesian methodology. Substructure is added to the \trento\ parametric initial condition model using Gaussian nucleons with a variable number of Gaussian partons. We vary the number and width of these partons while recovering the desired inelastic proton-proton cross section and ensemble averaged proton density. We then run the model through a large number of minimum bias hydrodynamic simulations and measure the response of final particle production and azimuthal particle correlations to initial state properties. Once these response functions are determined, we calibrate free parameters of the model using established Bayesian methodology. We comment of the implied viability of our partonic model and implications for hydrodynamic behavior in small systems.

\section{Introduction}
\label{}

Recent measurements of azimuthal particle correlations in small collision systems show striking simularities to flow signatures observed in gold-gold and lead-lead collisions, leading many to question if the origin of small system correlations is hydrodynamic in nature.
